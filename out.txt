A particular concern I have is the fact that they pay to delete every negative post about them. This isn\u2019t made up, I\u2019ve literally witnessed it happen. The reason why this is especially problematic is because this chapter has MASSIVE issues with racism that was handled so badly, it led to almost every single black sister dropping. Can you imagine? Almost every black woman leaving a chapter thats known for having so many women of color?! Well, if DZ continues their trend of deleting negative posts, abs delete this one as well as the one on their specific review page, they will be showing all of us that they are STILL continuing to silence black voices. I want to make this as public as possible so you all can see first hand the lack of respect this chapter has for POC\u2019s. The most insulting part of it all is that they managed to sweep the whole racism thing under the rug pretty easily. Once again, not okay. DZ needs to be held accountable for the damage they\u2019ve done to the black community, and honestly they should issue a public statement at least acknowledging what happened. It\u2019s the least they could do. All eyes are on you, ladies. ",

I have put my heart and sole into my organization and I feel as if the chapter and it\u2019s members have not reciprocated that feeling back to me. The people whom I met during my recruitment process were absolutely amazing, but sadly I don\u2019t see the same people behind the closed doors of chapter meetings and chapter events. I want so badly to fall in love with my chapter again, but I fear we are passed the point of redemption.  I ask these new executive board leaders to look into their own chapter and find those like myself who need to be reminded of the love they once had for their organization. Remind us in these troubling times why we joined Greek life to begin with. ",

Alpha phi was full of great looks...but seemed soooo superficial and fake. They do seem like they enjoy each other\u2019s company though. Delta Zeta had little to offer and is holding very few events this year...they seem uninvolved. Delta Gamma threw so many girls at you during rounds that I truly couldn\u2019t get a good read. However, judging from their Instagram posts, they went for looks again and seem catty. Alpha Delta Pi was very meh...I didn\u2019t get invited back after round 1 so idk much about them except they seem so mediocre. Alpha Gamma Delta had some rude members, but overall seemed like they don\u2019t do much for their philanthropy and seemed mediocre as well. ",

Your best chances of getting a bid is to be yourself, allow your recruitment guides to help you and take their advice! Be open minded, you may have your heart set on one chapter, but one chapter may totally be in love with you! If you stay open minded and trust the process you will have a strong chance of getting a bid into a house :-) in the past, there\u2019s been a very small amount of time women who have not received bids (like 3) but that could be for a variety of reasons. Just follow through with recruitment and your recruitment guides will be able to talk ya through it all!",

As far as joining a chapter in the fall, formal recruitment will be in September! You will get to meet every chapter and connect with women from all over! In the end you will get to decide which chapter you feel most connected to! Just stay up to date on @uofa_phc Instagram page and the individual chapters social media to see all of the events that we will be having in the fall and how to sign up for recruitment!

                "text": "The University of Akron has a strict no hazing policy. There have been rumors of hazing, but as a sorority woman, I have not personally experienced that. My chapter's national headquarter's has a no hazing policy as well. I am not sure about others, but most seem friendly. As a new pledge, my sorority welcomed me with open arms and they treated me with love and respect. I think hazing and new member treatment can vary but on this campus, hazing in sororities does not seem to be a problem. \n\nAs for Big/Little reveal, it varies from chapter to chapter. My chapter has an event where the littles are presented with their big sister. However, my pledge class was smaller since we joined COB and a smaller group went out to eat together. There were gifts and laughs and getting my big was one of the greatest experiences! It really depends from chapter to chapter, but some can be big events and some can be laid back.\n\nI think Akron's sororities are different because Greek life is a lot bigger on other campuses like KSU or OSU. Greek life here is very small which I find makes it a much more intimate experience. Greek life is truly what you make of it, and if you are a PNM, I hope you find your home. Don't listen to all of the reviews you read on this website. Meet them and go off your own experience! ",

You know your fraternity better than any of us on the outside and if something is wrong fix it. Identify the problem, talk it over with some individual Brothers to see if they agree, build a team of support to take it to chapter meeting, discuss it, make a plan to change it, and resolve the issue. If there are bunch of problems you are really going to have to buckle down and get some small victories as they come. Note to the wise.... It all starts with recruitment, member development, and accountability. \nIf you recruit crap....well you have crap. Don't settle for \"He's a nice guy\" look for objective facts like stuff hes involved in, GPA, family life, or ask why he is interested in greek life (if its only partying or hanging out those are often red flags). \nNow counter intuitive to my previous point, sometimes you can recruit a prospect who doesn't seem ideal but only if you know he's coachable. Most freshman will do anything to join and are very coachable at this time..meaning they will listen and comply with what you ask or advise.This is where development comes in. Guide a young man the proper way and he will be a rockstar for your chapter in the future. \nFinally accountability. All of us could use a dose of this from time to time. Look at your ritual, creed, and purpose. I assume you practice it every week. Analyze it...understand it!",

                "text": "As great as it might be to try and find a place in the top tier, you really have to pick a frat or sorority based on how well you like them, not based solely on their \"ranking.\"  Screw the haters.  Most people who comment on the houses are from other sororities who are trying to bring down the reputation's of others.  Me?  I go to Akron but left my frat at Miami.  I don't have a chapter here and am not going to start one.  But having been in the greek system, Im probably the most qualified one on here to judge them.  If you really want additional Information seek out the greek life director and see if they have information on each sorority.  Try to look for the one's that are involved in community and academics. GPA needs to be above a 2.5 and community involvement certainly helps.  These are warning signs that help show how well the sisterhood works together and most likely how they act towards each other.  A more successful organization will have better results in those fields.  If your just looking to party, then look for ones with low results in these fields.  That being said, never, ever, rely solely on the internet forums to make your decision.  Even the positive one's will be biased.  Unless you've been living under a rock, people can speak ANONYMOUSLY.",

Never see them out, never go to frat parties, and rarely hang out with other greeks. Kappa's don't win much either, but they always talk about how great their sisterhood is and are overall very nice girls. If you are joining a sorority for sisterhood and friendship, this one is for you.\n\nAlpha Gamma Delta- Probably the most well rounded sorority. They're a mix of other sororities qualities. A portion go out all the time and are social, a portion focus on school mostly and another portion might be a mix. Mostly nice girls and associate with the biggest group of fraternities than other instead of being exclusive to one or two. If you're joining a sorority for a variety of reasons, this one is for you.",

There's only a select group of them that actually go out and if they do, it's with cliques of just the girls. A majority are obsessed with school work a study constantly and therefore only have a small group of friends. They do always win the awards, so I guess being anti-social pays off. If you're joining a sorority for the philanthropy and to have it on your resume, this is the one.\n\nAlpha Phi- Probably the most attractive. They're definitely a younger sorority, with mostly having freshmen. Extremely social though, always show up to frat parties and bars. Alpha Phi's are definitely the most outgoing sorority. They don't have a house and rarely win awards, but have improved over the past 2 or 3 years. Very fun to be around. If you're joining a sorority to be social and have fun, this one is for you.\n\nDelta Gamma- Not much to say about them. They're a mixed group group of girls and probably the least social. Like ADPi, they're often spending weekends studying in their house. They only really associate with 1 or 2 fraternities and are rarely seen out except for 1 group. Don't win too many awards, either. Overall, quiet in the Greek scene. If you're joining a sorority for mostly the same reason as ADPi, this one is for you.",

So chances are you were kicked out because you couldn't cut grades, pay, or violated precepts of The Bond. You also demonstrate how little you know of the building of the house. We have a legacy wall of Brothers who emptied their pockets to make it possible. Maybe you missed that in the semester you spent with us. You've also completely missed out on the changes that have occurred internally so I assume your 5-21-12 posting is a bit delayed. There is a reason you are no longer a Brother. Get over it and come chat with me if you want to see whats really going on.\n\r\nMatt Cavallaro\r\nPresident",

Yet independents and chapters alike were caught doing it anyway. You also seem to be forgetting that Mike acted as an IFC officer, not a Phi Delt, but people cant get past blaming him as a Phi.
